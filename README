+	###  SHORTCUT VIRUS REMOVER  #####	+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These scripts retrieve user files and folders and remove shortcut virus from external devices like pendrives. 
The signature for the shortcut virus it removes is that the virus creates a batch script in the folder it affects 
and converts everything in the folder it affects into a shortcut.

To remove the shortcut virus in a folder. Download the scripts and if you are on windows copy shortcut_virus_remover.py
into the folder and click on it or using the CMD change directory to that folder and run the command:
		python shortcut_virus_remover.py 

However on linux you can either use shortcut_virus_remover.sh or shortcut_virus_remover.py. From the terminal change and 
copy the virus scanner scripts you downloaded to the folder you want to scan. Run either of this commands:
	sh ./shortcut_virus_remover.sh 
OR
	python ./shortcut_virus_remover.py
