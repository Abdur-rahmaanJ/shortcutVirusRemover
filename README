+       SHORTCUT VIRUS REMOVER         +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These scripts retrieve user files and folders and remove shortcut virus from external drives 
like pendrives. The signature of the shortcut virus it removes is that the virus 
creates a batch script in the folder it affects and converts everything in the folder 
it affects into a shortcut. This virus takes the advantage of windows autorun or autoplay
to affects external drives. This virus affects computers when an infected drive is inserted 
into it and the user trys to write or read from it. This means that whenever there is either 
a read or write to the inserted drive the virus script is run.
