+       SHORTCUT VIRUS REMOVER         +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These scripts retrieve user files and folders and remove shortcut virus from USB storage drives 
like pendrives. The signature of the shortcut virus (it removes) is that the virus 
creates a batch script in the folder it affects and converts everything in the folder 
into a shortcut(ie .lnk file). This virus takes the advantage of windows autorun or autoplay
feature to spread. The virus affects computers when an infected usb storage drive is inserted 
into the computer and the user trys to write or read from it. This means that whenever there is either 
a read or write to the inserted drive the virus script is run. 

So just opening an infected USB storage device using any file manager will get your 
Computer infected because the file manager has to read the various datastructures on 
the USB device to display icons of the files on the drive.
